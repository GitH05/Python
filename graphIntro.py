""""
graph:collection of the vertex(node) and the edge(arc)

1.directed graph: have pair of order vertices(directed toward a particular direction)
2.undirected graph: have pair of unordered vertices(can backtrack and move forward)

adjascency matrix:v*v matrix
-O(v^2)

adjascency list: array linked list is used,size==number of vertices
-saves space:O(|V|+|E|)
-worst case:O(V^2)
-adding  a vertex is easier
